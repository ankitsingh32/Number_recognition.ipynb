📌 Number Recognition
📖 Project Overview
This project focuses on handwritten digit recognition using machine learning techniques. The model is trained on image data to accurately identify numbers from 0 to 9. This is a common application in Optical Character Recognition (OCR) systems used in various industries such as banking, postal services, and document processing.

📂 Dataset
The project uses a dataset containing handwritten digits, likely sourced from popular datasets like MNIST or similar. Each image represents a single digit with pixel intensity values as input features.

⚙️ Technologies Used
Python (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn),
Machine Learning Frameworks (Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras),
Jupyter Notebook,
OpenCV (if image preprocessing is needed)

📊 Key Steps
Data Preprocessing – Normalization, reshaping, and augmentation of image data.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Visualizing dataset distributions and identifying patterns.
Model Training – Implementing and training models like CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) or traditional classifiers.
Evaluation & Optimization – Tuning hyperparameters to improve accuracy.
Prediction & Testing – Testing the model on unseen handwritten digits.
